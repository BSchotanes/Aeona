The Desert can be a very harsh place- 
though, the more I spend time here,
the more I feel there is beauty to behold.
What do you think?

You've come to a place full of rich History.

< Rich History? >					< I'm just going to walk away.. >

Indeed.  Would you like to hear the tale?

< Of course! >						< I'm just going to walk away.. >


Long ago- Ani, God of Tempest fell in love with
Laylee- great Queen of the Desert.  Their love created
a well of bounty.  Legend has it, the well is real and is
in the Northern region of the Desert.  My father once said 
he saw the Oasis with his own eyes, but many travelers ended
up dismissing our stories as propogated lies to entice people
to visit our barren land more often.

< But I believe you..>

Thank you dear child.
I know in my heart I will see the Oasis one day.  But you
haven't even heard the best part!

<There's more?>

Well Laylee and Ani bore mystical children!
I don't know much about them, but my father said they won't 
speak to anyone unless they introduce themselves to all 
siblings.  Who knows what secrets they share!
