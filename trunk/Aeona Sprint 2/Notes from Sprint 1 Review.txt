John's Commments
if you save the game and load it again particles effects stack with each other
fix collision so that if you don't get stuck on an object if you're moving in multiple vectors
get everything working with the controller
up the maximum value for tile options numeric up downs
large tilesets cause slow down
usafe filenames in save file from tile editor
collision painting could cause a slow down on level creation
paint bucket may help with map creation

My observations
change settings on menu using arrow keys
