Most of the tilesets were gotten from the site
http://www.reinorpg.com/resources/
The first word in their filenames is the username of the person who made the tileset.
The site requires everybody to give the right credits to those who make tilesets, and I actually want to do that, since some are definetely really good and I've grown up supporting the RPG Maker community.
So I think that in the credits we should have "Tileset Graphics" and name the sites we use and all the user names.

Tiles made by "REFMAP" were gotten from this japanese website:
http://www.tekepon.net/fsm/
Give credit too.
