TILE EDITOR AND ENGINE

// Important
- correctly use relative file paths (when saving the tileset image)
- undo and redo
- need to implement shutdown/unload methods for tileset and map
- have an overloaded function for check collisions that instead of taking an IBaseCharacter takes directly all the attributes needed for it.


- zoom (change scaling)
- paint
- play(?)
- if user tries to load invalid files, give an error message instead of crashing
- save button (not only save as)
- when saving the tileset, have it save the image to the resource folder in the project
