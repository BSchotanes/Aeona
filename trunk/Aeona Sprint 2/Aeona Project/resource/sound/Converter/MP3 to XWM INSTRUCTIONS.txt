XAudio2 only supports .wav files for sfx and .xwm for music files.
.xwm has a better compression rate than .mp3 so your .xwm files will be smaller.


Step 1.	Find a free .mp3 to .wav converter on the internet
	Google this: "download free .mp3 to .wav converter"

Step 2.	Convert .mp3 to .wav

Step 3. Put the .wav in this folder
Step 4.	Run the "convert_wav_to_xwm.bat" by double clicking it

Step 5. Copy the .xwm into your game's resource folder and load it with XAudio2! :)


NOTE:	ALL .wav files in the directory will be converted when you run the .bat
	so please take them out of the folder when you are done.

	Also, if you make sub folders inside this folder, all .wav files
	in those sub folders will be converted too.
