</SpeechNode>

<SpeechNode text="Glad you asked.  You see- when I was very young, my father left my mother.  I was heartbroken and couldn't find solice in knowing I was unwanted.  For many years, my mother would curse my name, claiming I was the reason father left.  I think he may have thought I was an abomination when I was born.  I know I look different, but I also think that makes me special.  I have no idea where my father went, or why he left. Nothing made me feel better and it even got worse when I reached my adolescent years.  During that dark chapter of my life, I started rebeling.  I picked up a wooden stick and hurlded it at an oak tree.  I picked the stick back up and forcefully began to strike the bark.  I hit the stick over and over until it bruised the tree.  When the Stick broke, I didn't stop- I repeatedly beat the Oak tree until my hands started to splinter.  I don't know why I acted so violent towards that old tree- maybe it was because of my mother; or maybe it was my father.  I only now realize I was mad at myself, mad that I couldn't amount to anything other than the neighborhood bastard child.  I was ugly on the outside and felt alone.  I picked up another stick and started to fashion it into something sharper.  This time, I really wanted to cause pain to the Oak tree.  I wanted it to feel the way I did everyday.  I spent hours stabbing and marking that tree with cuts and abrasions that became deeper and darker as the sap seeded through.  I went back home and grabbed cutting knives to further cristen my hate. I did this for several years and began making my own tools; tools to more efficiently cut and cause harm. My purpose in life became clear to me when I discoverd my natural abilities to forge weapons and empower echanted ones; Weapons like the one you are holding in your hands.  I know you are a Hero.  You are holding the Ryza blade are you not?  That weapon is truly powerful.  It can cut almost anything in two and can even change the land.  I know I am crazy, but I can teach you the art of weaponry.  It is who I am: an unwanted child, a deranged child beating the living heck out of an old oak tree, a crafter of tools, a psychotic man living on a barren island, a powerful blacksmith, No! The Greatest Blacksmith in all of Valest!  What am I?  A monster.... HrrHahaha..  at your service!"name="BlackSmith16">
